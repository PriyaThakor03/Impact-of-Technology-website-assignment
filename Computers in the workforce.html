	<h3>Usage of Computers in the Workforce</h3> 
		<ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <p>Office employment has not been exempted from the numerous sectors that have been revolutionised by computers. By offering a variety of software and communication features to assist in carrying out job duties, computers have contributed to increasing the productivity and accuracy of office workers. 
	Most organisations can no longer function without the usage of computers, with computers being found in almost every office.</p>

	<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
	<p> Digital records are susceptible to unauthorised access, whether as a result of hacking or employee negligence over security. Data loss can result in severe responsibility for the organisation concerned, particularly if carelessness is suspected, especially when it comes to sensitive legal and medical documents. 
	Digital record disposal poses a unique challenge, especially in shared networks. 
	Just as throwing a document in the garbage does not stop someone from later recovering the paper, simply deleting a file does not totally remove a digital record.</p>
