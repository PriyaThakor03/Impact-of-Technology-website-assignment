		<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
		<p> What is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. </p>
	<h3>Usage of Artificial Intelligence</h3> 
		<ul> 
			<li>Online shopping and advertising </li>
			<li>Machine translations </li>
			<li>Smart homes </li>
			<li>Cars </li>
			<li>Cybersecurity </li>
			<li>Health </li>
			<li>Transport </li>
			<li>Manufacturing </li>
			<li>Public administration and services</li>
		</ul> 
		
    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ol> 
		<li>Reduction in Human Error: With artificial intelligence, choices are made by using a certain set of algorithms on the information that has already been obtained. 
		As a result, mistakes are decreased and there is an opportunity to achieve accuracy with a higher level of precision. </li>
		<li>Risk-taking instead of Humans: By creating an AI robot that can perform dangerous tasks on our behalf, we can get beyond many of the risky restrictions that come with being a human.  </li>	
		<li>Available 24x7: Unlike humans, robots don't become bored while they operate nonstop for 24 hours straight because of AI. </li>	
		<li>Helping with Repetitive Jobs: By using artificial intelligence, we can efficiently automate these menial chores and even eliminate "boring" work for humans, freeing them up to become more creative. </li>	
		<li>Faster Decisions: By combining AI with other technologies, we can make computers make judgments and act faster than a person. </li>	
	</ol>

	<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>High costs of creation: As AI changes daily, hardware and software must be upgraded over time to stay current with demands. 
		Machines require regular maintenance and repair, which is expensive.  </li>	
		<li>Making Humans Lazy: Because most work is now automated by AI apps; this has the effect of making people lazy.  </li>	
		<li>Unemployment: Human intervention is decreasing as robots take over the bulk of repetitive chores and other jobs, which will have a significant impact on employment standards. </li>	
	</ol>
