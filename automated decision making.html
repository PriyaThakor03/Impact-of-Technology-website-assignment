    <h2>Automated Decision Making</h2>
	<p> What is Automated Decision Making?
	Making a decision without the intervention of a human being is known as automated decision-making. 
	These choices may be supported by true information, digitally generated profiles, or inferred information. 
	Examples of this include: 
	<ul>
	<li>a decision to provide a loan made online; and</li>
	<li>a recruiting aptitude exam that employs pre-programmed algorithms and criteria.</li>
	</ul> </p>
	
	<h3>Usage of Automated Decision Making</h3>

			<li>Health</li>

		</ul> 
		
    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <p>In several industries, including healthcare, education, financial services, and marketing, profiling, and automated decision-making may be highly helpful for businesses as well as for individuals. 
	They can result in judgments that are made more rapidly and consistently, especially when a lot of data has to be promptly examined and choices need to be made.  </p>

	<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
	<p> People may not understand how the process works or how it may effect them, and they may not anticipate their personal information to be used in this way. 
	The choices made might have a big negative impact on certain people.
	Just because data analysis reveals a link doesn't always indicate it's important. 
	There will always be a margin of error because the method can only make assumptions about someone's conduct or attributes, therefore it is necessary to balance the risks of adopting the findings. 
	These dangers are addressed by the UK GDPR requirements.</p>
