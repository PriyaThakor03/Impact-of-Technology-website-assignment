    <h2>Ethical Issues</h2>
	<ul>
    <h3><li>Censorship & The Internet</h3></li>
	<p>The act of suppressing the content that people are able to view, publish and access. ISPs block content associated with terrorism and extremist political beliefs. People worry that censorship may be misused to push a certain ideology. Some people believe in the idea of a ‘Free Internet’, where nothing is filtered at all. Censorship can exist on a smaller level, such as within a school or workplace. Censorship may be used to maintain productivity and prevent distractions. </p>
	
    <h3><li>Monitoring Behaviour</h3></li>
    <p>Computers are used to monitor people’s behaviour in various environments. Employers monitor productivity by tracking the websites workers are accessing. Surveillance systems, such as CCTV cameras, are used to detect crime. Ankle monitors are used to track people under house arrest. Some argue that this is unethical and contravenes basic human rights. Others argue that this is essential to put people off committing crime.</p>
	
    <h3><li>Analysis of Personal Information</h3></li>
	<p> Recent years have seen a sharp increase in cybercrime, making user information more exposed than before. Organisations of every size and purpose must commit to using data ethically as they strengthen the security of their information systems in response to these challenges.
		Understanding the many privacy issues that affect consumers when they engage with digital platforms is the first step in this process. Users worry about their information being used for things other than what is in their own best interests, from fraud to data selling. </p>
	
	<h3><li>Piracy & Offensive Communications</h3></li>
	<p>The unauthorised copying of content, such as software or media and is a form of theft, though the Internet has made it easy to source these types of content online. The Internet provides a seemingly anonymous front for offensive communication. Offensive communication includes online harassment, cyber-bullying or stalking. The Malicious Communications Act introduced in 1998 makes it a criminal offence to send indecent or offensive messages to anyone online. </p>
	
	<h3><li>User Interface Design Considerations</h3></li>
	<ol>
	<li>Layout</li>
	<p>Web developers must consider who will be viewing websites when designing them.  The Equality Act introduced in 2010 makes it illegal to discriminate against providing a service to a certain group of people.  It must be easy for users to navigate between pages.  Menus must be displayed on the appropriate side of the page depending on how the language is read. People with visual impairments may need to enlarge text or alter the contrast. Websites should provide alt text for images and provide a screen magnifier option.  Transcripts of audio files should be provided for those with hearing impairments. </p>
	
	<li>Colour Paradigms </li>
	<p>Web designers must consider how colours are interpreted around the world. Some colours are regarded as unlucky in certain cultures.  </p>
  
	<li>Character Sets </li>
	<p>Websites should be accessible to as wide an audience as possible.
	www.pmt.education. Website content needs to be translated into multiple languages. Unicode is the preferred character set for this as it is able to represent over a million
	characters. </p>
	</ol>
